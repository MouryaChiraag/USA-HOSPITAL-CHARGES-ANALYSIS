# USA-HOSPITAL-CHARGES-ANALYSIS
The Hospital Charges dataset has more than 150,000 records of treatment of various ailments in several US hospitals. Some stats about the data set are:
a. The data set has a record of 100 ailments.
b. It has a list of 3000+ healthcare providers (hospitals, medical centres, etc.).
c. It has data from 50 states and approximately 2000 cities across the USA.
d. It describes the cost of treatment for approximately 7 million patients.
Each record (or row) is a unique combination of state, city, ailment and provider. It also lists the average cost of treatment for a particular ailment.
I have analysed this ‘raw’ data set and prepared a ‘report’, which has the list of providers treating a specific ailment in a particular state of the USA. Subsequently, i have ranked providers by the cost of treatment. Such a ‘report’ will be extremely useful to government agencies and patients across the state. Instead of analysing the entire data set, they will now use this report to find the cheapest healthcare provider in their city. Think of this report as a sorted ‘Yellow Pages’ or ‘Dictionary’.
